**What the hell is FantasyScrapper?**

It's a tool that will scrape data from the fantasy teams(https://fantasy.iplt20.com/) and will push it to an excel-sheet so that this data can be analysed by the players.


**Why is this done?**

It's painful to click and look at each team and their status over a long season, this provides an automated way to gather this data in one place so that players can get all arsenal at their disposal to look and strategize.

**Finally:** Update the cookie and enjoy the scrapper do its work and give out a lazyGenius.xlsx file. This file will have all the data needed for the players.
